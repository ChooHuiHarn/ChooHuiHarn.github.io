  <div class="discription">
    <p>Hera's mythology mostly revolves around her marriage to her brother. Zeus cheats on her and has many children with other goddesses and mortal women. She is intensely jealous and vindictive towards his children and their mothers, and punishes the children or their mothers. Hera was the Olympian queen of the gods, and the goddess of marriage, women, family and the protector of women during childbirth. She was usually depicted wearing a crown and holding a royal, lotus-tipped sceptre, and accompanied by a peacock or cuckoo.</p>
