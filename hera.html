  She was usually depicted wearing a crown and holding a royal, lotus-tipped sceptre, and accompanied by a peacock or cuckoo.</p>

<p>Hera's mythology mostly revolves around her marriage with her brother. Zeus cheats on her and has many children with other goddesses and mortal women. 
  She is intensely jealous and vindictive towards his children and their mothers, and punishes the children or their mothers.</p>
