<p>Hades was the king of the underworld and the god of the dead.
   He presided over funeral rites and ensured that the dead received the proper burial.</p>

<p>Hades was devoured by Cronus as soon as he was born, along with four of his siblings.
   Zeus later made the Titan spit out the siblings, and together they defeated the Titan gods, locking them away in the pit of Tartarus. 
  Afterward, the three brothers drew lots to divide the cosmos, and Hades received the third portion, which became his domain: the realm of the underworld. </p>
