<p>Hestia was the virgin goddess of the hearth and home. As the protector of the family hearth, she oversaw the cooking of bread and the preparation of family meals.
   Hestia was also the goddess of the sacrificial flame and received a portion of every sacrifice made to the gods. The cooking of the communal feast with sacrificial meat was part of her domain.
   She was usual depicted wearing a veil and holding flowered branch that maybe a chaste tree </p>

<p>Hestia was the firstborn child of Cronus and Rhea, but her father swallowed her at birth. Later, Zeus forced the old Titan to vomit out Hestia and her siblings.
    As the first to be swallowed she was also the last to be spit out, and so was named as both the eldest and youngest of the six Olympian.
      When the gods Apollon and Poseidon sought her hand in marriage, Hestia refused and requested Zeus to allow her to remain an eternal virgin. 
      He agreed, and she took her place at his royal hearth.</p>
