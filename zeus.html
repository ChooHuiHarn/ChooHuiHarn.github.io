      <p>Zeus was the King of the Gods and the god of the sky, weather, law and order, destiny and fate, and kingship.
        His usual attributes were a lightning bolt, a royal sceptre and an eagle.</p>

      <p>Zeus is the youngest child of Cronus and Rhea. Cronus devoured each of his children as they were born, but Rhea saved Zeus by giving him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow instead.
        She hid him in a cave on Crete, where he was nursed by the nymph Amalthaea and protected by the Curetes, who clashed their weapons together to muffle the baby's cries.
        When Zeus grows up, he leads a revolt against the Titans. With the help of his siblings, he succeeded in dethroning Cronus and then divided dominion over the world among them.</p>
