<p>Demeter was the Greek goddess of agriculture, grain, and bread, sustaining mankind with the earth's rich bounty.
  She was often depicted wearing a crown, bearing sheafs of wheat, a cornucopia, or a torch. She was sometimes with animals like pigs, snakes, or cranes.

<p>Demeter oversaw one of the leading Mystery Cults that offered its initiates a path to a blessed afterlife in Elysium.
   One of her most famous myths is about how her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped, and she refused to let anything grow until her daughter returned.</p>
